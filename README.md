# linux-manage-file-permissions

## Scenario ##

Review the scenario below. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

Note: This scenario involves investigating and updating the same file permissions as the ones in the
